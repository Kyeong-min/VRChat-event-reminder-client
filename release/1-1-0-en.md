# 1.1.0 release note (english)

## Improvements
* A button to copy the event summary and detailed information in the event details window has been added.
* In the event details window, if there is a URL related to the event in the event details, an attempt is made to display a button to navigate to that URL.
* Changed so that the display of canceled events can be set in the event search window.
  * It is set to not be displayed by default.
* Improved the event search so that it does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters when searching for the summary.
  * ex) Even if you search by quest, a summary containing Quest is searched.

## Fix the problem
* There was a possibility that information on some events could be omitted due to server problems, but this has been corrected.
* A problem in which the log was not recorded normally due to a permission problem has been fixed.
